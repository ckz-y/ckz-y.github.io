    <h1>Coleman Yanagisawa</h1>
    <p>Masters of Science in Advanced Computer Science Candidate at the University of Oxford.</p>
    <p>Previously, I received a Bachelor's of Science in Engineering 
        in Operations Research and Financial Engineering with Honors from Princeton University. 
        There, I conducted my senior thesis research with Ioannis Akrotirianakis, 
        which investigated equitable urban cycling networks expansion using mathematical optimization. 
        During my time at Princeton, I also interned at IBM's Chief Analytics Office and at Amtrak as a data analyst intern.

        I am broadly interested in the applications of data for social good.
