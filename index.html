    <h1>Coleman Yanagisawa</h1>
    <p>Masters of Science in Advanced Computer Science Candidate at the University of Oxford.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated with Honors from Princeton University with a Bachelor's of Science in Engineering 
        in Operations Research and Financial Engineering and certificates in Statistics and Machine Learning and Computer Science. 
        My senior thesis research, conducted with Dr. Ioannis Akrotirianakis, investigated equitable urban cycling network expansion
        using mathematical optimization.
        During my time at Princeton, I also interned at IBM's Chief Analytics Office and at Amtrak.
